Get to the point bro is an account on tiktok that summeraizes peoples long winded videos.

This is an experimental app under development to make an AI version of Get To The Point Bro

STATUS: The transcription is not good. Someone could try openAI or some other tool to get better summeries. Then you'd just need a robot voice to read it and an image to look at.

My vision is to have a tool to produce summeries along with a funny image to create a parody of, 'Get To The Point Bro'.

I asked midjourney for, "French podcaster in hoodie" and it made some good images, something like that might work for the image. Shown in `/images`
